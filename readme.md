## Requirements

Use the package manager [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install required Python dependencies. Note: We used Python 3.7.

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

## Training

The following command will train and predict for all regions from epidemic week 9 to 15:

```bash
python ./main.py --start_week 9 --end_week 15
```

You can set up your own model hyperparameter values (e.g. learning rate, loss weights) in the file ```./experiment_setup/feature_module/model_specifications/global_recurrent_feature_model.json```.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the results, go to ```evaluate.py``` and change line 71 for the name of results file (saved in folder ```rmse_results```). Then, run.

```bash
python ./evaluate.py
```
